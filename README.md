# Test Cloud Foundry's auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities on IBM Cloud

In traditional computing, hardware resources have always been a restriction meaning that, for instance, when a web server receives more requests that it could handle, it simply dies because it is bounded by the hardware resources inside. In today's fast-paced digital world, applications need to constantly respond and adapt to the ever-changing environment we're in.

Thankfully, cloud computing came to the rescue introducing features like auto-scaling and self-healing. Auto-scaling scales up or down the computing resources automatically according to the current load on the application giving your application consistent and predictable performance under different loads and situations. And self-healing basically restarts your applications whenever it detects that the app has crashed or is down, this increase the overall availablity of your applications.

These features enabled developers to build resilient and fault-tolerant applications which can handle changes and preform well under pressure.  

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to setup auto-scaling in cloud foundry on IBM Cloud. You will also learn how to load test your application and use the metrics tab on IBM Cloud's Cloud Foundry to monitor the app's CPU usage and see it as it scales up and down automatically.

Finally, this tutorial will also test and show how cloud foundry self-heals crashed applications. This give developers an idea on how can they utilize cloud foundry to better serve their apps.
